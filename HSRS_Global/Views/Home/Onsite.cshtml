          <p>Ravi provided PRINCE2<sup>&reg;</sup> Foundation and Practitioner training to me in March 2014. Ravi's has extensive real-world experience in project management, in-depth theoretical knowledge of PRINCE2<sup>&reg;</sup> and is a good communicator. These skills enabled Ravi to present a large volume of complex information to myself and other students in an efficient way, enabling us to excel in the PRINCE2<sup>&reg;</sup> course. 
<br>
I recommend Ravi as a trainer in project management courses such as PRINCE2<sup>&reg;</sup>. <br>
